## Task Details
### Services to be broadcasted:
* Temperature Measurement
* Humidity

### Details about the service to broadcast over Bluetooth
* Service UUID: 00000002-0000-0000-FDFD-FDFDFDFDFDFD.
* Characteristics:
  * Temperature Measurement: Standard BLE characteristic - GATT Char UUID: 0x2A1C.
  * Humidity: Standard BLE characteristic - GATT Char UUID: 0x2A6F.
* Supported operations: Both characteristics support read and notify.

## Hardware Components Used
1. Espressif System's ESP32 Devkit V1 development board
2. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor
3. 10K Ohm Resistor (Pull-up)
4. USB to MicroUSB cable
5. Breadboard
6. Jumpers

## Tools Used
### Arduino IDE 
Arduino Integrated Development Environment or Arduino Software (IDE) contains a text editor for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a series of menus. It connects to the Arduino hardware to upload programs and communicate with them. 
* For more details refer: <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software>

### Fritzing
Fritzing is an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics accessible as creative material for anyone. We offer a software tool, a community website and services in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, fostering a creative ecosystem that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and layout and manufacture professional PCBs. 
* For more details refer: <https://fritzing.org/>

## Microcontroller Interfacing
* Used OneWire protocol to interface the microcontroller to the DHT11 sensor:
* Used BLE protocol for Connectivity with the nRF Connect Mobile Application.

## Issues Faced and Resolution
### ESP32 Not Advertising after disconnection
### Approach 1: Used the callback function to restart advertising within the loop itself.
* Result = Successfully connected and reconnected multiple times with no issues (Check at the end of the [Project Overview Video](#Project-Overview-Video)).

### BLE Data transmission problem
### Approach 1: Started with using custom characteristic UUIDs and tried to send the data as String values (I had worked on this before).
* Result = Successfully received both values Temperature Measurement & Humidity in Strings.
* Comment = This was not asked in the task. It was mandatory to use the default GATT UUIDs.

### Approach 2: Set the UUIDs to the required UUIDs (Temperature Measurement = 0x2A1C; Humidity = 0x2A6F) and tried to send the data as String values.
* Result = Error: Invalid Data Syntax @ nRF Application for Temperature Measurement value & Garbage value for Humidity value.
* Comment = This was not asked in the task. Getting the Humidity in % and Temperature Measurement in Celsius was mandatory.

### Approach 3: Changed the Temperature characteristic UUID to default temperature (Temperature = 0x2AE6) and tried to send the data as unsigned 16-bit int. 
* Result = Successfully received both values Temperature Measurement & Humidity in unsigned 16-bit int values.
* Comment = Checked the BLE documentation for the UUIDs (Temperature = 0x2AE6; Humidity = 0x2A6F) and their required data syntax type required.

### Approach 4: Reset the Temperature characteristic UUID (Temperature Measurement = 0x2A1C) and tried to send the data as unsigned 16-bit int. 
* Result = Error: Invalid Data Syntax @ nRF Application for Temperature Measurement value, but successfully received values for Humidity in unsigned 16-bit int values.
* Comment = Checked the BLE documentation for the Temperature Measurement UUID (Temperature Measurement = 0x2A1C) and their required data syntax type required.

### Approach 5: Tried to convert the temperature data to 32-bit float and send the data along with the humidity data as unsigned 16-bit int. 
* Result = Successfully received both values Temperature Measurement & Humidity in unsigned 16-bit int values, but Temperature Measurement unit was in Fahrenheit scale.
* Comment = Checked the BLE documentation for the Temperature Measurement UUID (Temperature Measurement = 0x2A1C) and their required data syntax type required and flags.
* Comment = Checked the conversion requires an IEEE11073 32-bit float data stream with 5 bytes (1 byte for C/F and 4 bytes for the actual value).

### Approach 6: Changed the IEEE11073 32-bit float data stream with 5 bytes (1 byte for C/F and 4 bytes for the actual value) and set it to 0x00 flag for Celsius unit scale.
* Result = Successfully received both values Temperature Measurement & Humidity values on the nRF Connect Application with correct unit scales.
* Comment = Checked the BLE documentation for the Temperature Measurement UUID (Temperature Measurement = 0x2A1C) and their required data syntax type required and flags.
